== 1.0.0 (was 0.9.4) ==
* [OK] Display message, if offline

* [OK] Update translations

== 1.1.0 ==
* [OK] Performance improvements for scrolling the list
* [OK] Basic image editing. Zooming & Overlays
* [OK] Share button is jumpy. We should implement our own action (as originally planned)
* Editing an edited image adds more and more effects. We should keep the original somewhere and use that.

== Future versions ==
* Add caching of tiles for usage in ListView and especially to prevent redownloading in DetailsView. The cache could simply cache URL/tile pairs. If the URL is not in cache we fetch the tile online. This could also be used for offline favorites, etc. We just need a flag to pin the cache entry. Non-pinned entries get delted after some time.
* Use "booster" for faster start-up
* Locally stored favorites
* Automatic background changing, e.g. each Monday one of my favorites
* Only load 2nd tab when needed
* Use new segmented title bar control (once it can be used properly on tabs with various toolbars - not gold SDK)
* Better handling of the offline situation. We could use app.online but enhance it so after each wake-up the app checks
  its online state. Because while sleeping the app receives no signals.
  With this change we could use a global overlay that informs the user that he needs to be online.
